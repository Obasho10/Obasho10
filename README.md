## üî≠ My Research Focus

Interdisciplinary research combining physics with computational methods.

### üß† Neural Networks in Physics
Developing machine learning approaches for solving complex physical systems, with applications in cosmology, quantum mechanics, and general relativity.
*   Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
*   Neural Network-based PDE Solvers
*   Bayesian Neural Networks for Uncertainty Quantification

### üî¨ Computational Physics
Numerical solutions to challenging physics problems through high-performance computing and efficient algorithms.
*   Domain Decomposition Methods
*   Parallel Computing (MPI, OpenMP)
*   Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**Current Work:** As an MSc Physics student at IIT Mandi, I'm currently researching neural network applications in cosmology, particularly in the analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation patterns. My approach combines traditional physics models with modern machine learning techniques to tackle computationally intensive problems in astrophysics and quantum systems.

**Research Goals:**
*   Develop more efficient computational methods for solving PDEs in physics
*   Apply machine learning to accelerate numerical simulations
*   Bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical computation
*   Improve accuracy and efficiency in modeling physical systems
